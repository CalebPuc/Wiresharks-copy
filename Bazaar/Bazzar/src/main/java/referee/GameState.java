/*
 * The referee's complete private knowledge about a running game.

 * TurnState from it containing only what the active player is
 * allowed to know.
 *
 * Data representation:
 *   bank:    pebbles available for trading
 *   visibles: the four face-up cards players may purchase
 *   deck:    remaining face-down cards not yet revealed
 *   players: all active players in turn order, each with a wallet
 *            and score; the first player is the active player.
 *            may be empty if all players have been eliminated --
 *            isGameOver() catches this case.
