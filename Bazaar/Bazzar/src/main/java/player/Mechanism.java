/*
 * The player mechanism -- wraps a strategy and handles the protocol
 * the referee uses to interact with a player.
 *
 * A mechanism has a name and a strategy. The referee calls it twice
 * per turn: once to get exchanges or a pebble request, and once to
 * get a list of cards to purchase.
 *
 * The mechanics are abstracted over a strategy -- the mechanism does
 * not know or care which strategy it holds, just that it implements
 * the Strategy interface.
 *
 * Data representation:
 *   name:     this player's name, unique within a game
 *   strategy: the strategy used to make decisions each turn
